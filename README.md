# android-uiautomator-for-UItesting

This is a UI testing tool for android mobile phone. We integrated two methods : Android uiautomator and shell script.
The purpose is that when user make a phone call and then connect with different types of Wi-Fi AP such as, 2.4GHz , 5GHz bandwidth, and 802.11 series. Using UIautomator we can simulate human being tapping , touching or sliding screen. On the other hands, shell script can arrange the test step,  dial phone , receive the comming phone , call uiautomator file (.jar) ,and finally export the test log.
