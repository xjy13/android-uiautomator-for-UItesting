# android-uiautomator-for-UItesting

This is the presentation for android phone UI testing. We combine two methods between  android uiautomator and shell script.
The purpose is that when user make a phone call and then connect with different types of WLAN AP. For instance, 2.5GHz or 5GHz bandwidth. Using UIautomator we can simulate human tapping , touching or sliding screen. On the other hands, shell script can arrange the test step, dial phone , receive the comming phone , call uiautomator file (.jar) ,and finally export the test log.
